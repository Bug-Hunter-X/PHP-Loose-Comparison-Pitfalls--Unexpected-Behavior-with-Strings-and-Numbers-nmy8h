This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in PHP related to loose comparisons and type juggling. The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison to ensure type safety and prevent unexpected results.  Loose comparisons can lead to subtle bugs, especially when dealing with interactions between strings and numbers, and when handling array keys.  Always consider using strict comparisons (`===`) to avoid potential issues.
