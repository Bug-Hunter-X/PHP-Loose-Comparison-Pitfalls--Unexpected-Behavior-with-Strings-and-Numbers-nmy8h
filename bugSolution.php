To resolve this, always use strict comparison (`===`) when you need to ensure both value and type are identical:

```php
$value = "10";
$number = 10;
if ($value === $number) {
    echo "Values are strictly equal";
} else {
    echo "Values are not strictly equal";
}
```

This will output "Values are not strictly equal" because the types are different.  For array keys, ensure you use string keys for predictable access:

```php
$arr = ["10" => 'ten'];
echo $arr["10"]; // Works correctly
echo $arr[10]; //Works correctly due to implicit conversion to string key
```
By consistently employing strict comparisons and careful type handling, you can eliminate these types of errors and create more robust and predictable PHP applications.
